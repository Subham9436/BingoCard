Project Overview:
The HTML Bingo project is a web-based interactive game that allows users to play Bingo online. This project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages. The game generates a random Bingo card for each player, allows them to mark off numbers as they are called, and determines when a player has achieved Bingo.

The game generates a 5x5 Bingo card with random numbers in the standard Bingo format.
The center space is marked as a "free" space.

User Interaction:

The game provides visual feedback (e.g., changing the background color of marked numbers) to indicate which numbers have been selected.


2.Bingo Detection:

The game checks for winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines) and alerts the player when they have achieved Bingo.
A message is displayed to congratulate the player, along with the winning pattern.

3.Reset Functionality:
